For example if your information need is about finding an overview of different cancer types, you could state that a document would need to list at least ten types of cancer to satisfy your information need (among other criteria). Write this down as a protocol with rules and examples. For example, such a protocol could state that at least three out of five given criteria have to be fulfilled for a document to be considered relevant for the information need, and then specify the criteria. Or your protocol could have the form of a sequence of rules, where each rule lets you either label the document as relevant or not relevant, or proceed with the next rule. Such rules and criteria can, for example, be about the general topic of the paper, the concepts mentioned in it, the covered relations between concepts, the type of publication (research paper, overview paper, etc.), the number of references, the types of contained diagrams, and so on, depending on your specified information need."
