**THIS IS STILL INCOMPLETE AND WORK-IN-PROGRESS!**

These are four assignments with introductory code and explanations in the form
of [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) by Paul Groth, derived
from exercises produced by Luís F. Simões for [VU Collective Intelligence
2013](https://github.com/lfsimoes/VU/tree/master/2013__Collective_Intelligence).
Converted to latest Jupyter version and Python 3 by Tobias Kuhn (9 October 2015).
